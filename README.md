This software deals with the graphic realization of weighted and directed graphs. </br>As part of implementing the graphs we implemented Node, Edge, Graph, and algorithms on the graph.</br>The algorithms we implemented are: finding a central node, finding the shortest route between two nodes and its length, checking if the graph is connected, and finding a solution to the problem of neighboring cities (tsp).</br>
In addition, the software has editing options for the graph, which are adding a node, deleting a node, connecting an edge, and deleting an edge.</br>


You can load graphs from json to decapitate the graphs and save again as a json file.</br>
We will now look at the graphical interface of the software </br>

In the file menu you can load a graph, save a graph and exit the program</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145414914-2169c8f6-b3c6-4d95-8db2-143b80588c8f.png"></br>

In the Edit menu you can display numbers representing the node id's, and the edge weights, by clicking add node it will be possible to add nodes on the graph (this is possible when this button is bold), you can remove node given node id, connect edge given src and dest are the id of the start and end node and in the same way of the connection you can also remove edge. </br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145415876-cd4df199-65ab-46fc-bbc1-ef7fd17bff96.png">
